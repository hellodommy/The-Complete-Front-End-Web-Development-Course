# Introduction

- HTML - defines elements on a web page.
- CSS - defines how those elements look.
- JavaScript - behavioural (eg. listening for button clicks).
- jQuery - a framework for JavaScript (simplified, meant for rapid development).

# Atom Setup

- Using a site-builder tool is limited and restrictive - does not give you much control.
- Use a good text editor instead.
  - Notepad lacks *syntax highlighting* and *autocompletion* (eg. closing tags).
  - Use text editor by [atom.io](https://atom.io/).

In Atom,
1. File -> Add Project Folder.
2. In project folder, Right-Click -> Add file -> named `index.html`.
3. Type out `Hello world` in the new file.
4. Open `index.html` in web browser and you should see the words `Hello world` on the page. You've written your first web page! :)
