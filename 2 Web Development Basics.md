# HTML Document Structure

- **Tags** are contained within pointy brackets `<>`.
- Beginning of an HTML document needs to open on an HTML tag that wraps around the entire page.
  - `<html> page stuff </html>`
- Good practice to increment the indent as you open a new tag.
- Other top level tags: `<head>` and `<body>`.
  - Things in `<head>` will not be shown on the page. It simply tells the browser more about the page.
    - Include a `<title>` tag that will appear on the window of your browser.
  - Everything in `<body>` will appear on the screen.
- **Element** includes the opening tag, all the text within it, and the closing tag.
