# Front End Web Development

This repo contains my notes and source files for [The Complete Front-End Web Development Course!](https://www.udemy.com/course/front-end-web-development/) I'm taking on Udemy this summer. I hope I can use skills picked up from this course to build beautiful, responsive sites for my personal projects.

You can view my test site [here](https://hellodommy.github.io/The-Complete-Front-End-Web-Development-Course/) though it still is a work in progress ðŸ˜….
